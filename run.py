"""Launch the options scanner (Streamlit) and the trading dashboard (Flask)
together, so the dashboard appears in the scanner's "Live Charts" tab.

    uv run run.py

Starts the Flask dashboard on http://localhost:5000 (also reachable
directly), waits for it to come up, then runs the Streamlit scanner on
http://localhost:8501. Both apps' logs stream to this one terminal,
prefixed `[scanner]` and `[dashboard]` so you can tell them apart. Ctrl+C
stops both. If a dashboard is already running on :5000, it is reused (not
restarted), and its logs stay in its own terminal.

To run either app on its own instead:
    uv run streamlit run options-scanner/run_app.py
    uv run trading-dashboard/app.py
