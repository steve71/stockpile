"""Schwab OAuth helper — run on initial setup and every 7 days after.

Saves a Schwab API token to disk. Run this before using Schwab as a data
source (CLI --data-source schwab, the web UI, or the trading dashboard),
and re-run it whenever the refresh token expires.

Two modes:

    uv run options-scanner/schwab_auth.py
        Browser flow. Opens a browser locally and captures the OAuth
        redirect automatically. Use this on your own machine.

    uv run options-scanner/schwab_auth.py --manual
        Headless flow for a remote/cloud host with no browser. Prints the
        login URL; you open it in any browser, log in, and paste the
        redirected URL back. The paste is read with getpass (hidden), so
        the one-time code never shows on screen or in a screen share.

Schwab issues a 7-day refresh token at OAuth time. Refreshing the access
token does NOT extend it, so its lifetime is capped at 7 days from this
script's last successful run. After that the next quote/chain call fails
and the tools surface a "Could not fetch ..." error — re-running this
script fixes it.

Security: the token file and config.toml both hold secrets, so this
script chmods them to 0600 (owner-only). That matters on shared
remote/cloud hosts; on Windows it's effectively a no-op (ACL-based).
