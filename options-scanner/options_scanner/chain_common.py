"""Shared helpers for the Yahoo (`chain.py`) and Schwab
(`schwab_chain.py`) chain fetchers.

Both providers walk a different raw shape — Yahoo gives us pandas
DataFrames from yfinance, Schwab gives us nested JSON dicts — but
once each call site has parsed out the per-contract fields, the
downstream work is identical: validate the quote, compute
log-moneyness and annualized yield, and emit a row in the
canonical 17-column schema the rest of the scanner consumes.

`build_option_row` is that downstream half. Each provider parses
its own raw structure and calls this with normalized floats/ints;
the helper applies the shared filters and returns either a dict
ready to append, or None when the quote is too sparse to keep.

Greeks (delta, gamma) come from the caller: Yahoo computes them
via Black-Scholes in chain.py; Schwab takes them straight from the
broker. The helper is Greek-agnostic.
