"""Scan-provenance stamps: data source + scan timestamp shown on every
chart and below every table so the context survives screenshots, HTML
exports, and Reddit reposts.

Also home to the canonical provider identity constants
(PROVIDER_LABELS, PROVIDER_COLORS) since they're consumed by the
stamp helpers and by the top-bar pill / sidebar source chip — one
source of truth keeps the green/blue convention in sync across the
chart subtitles, table captions, buttons, and pill chips.

Convention: stamp reads `scan_provider` (snapshotted at scan time),
NOT the live data-source dropdown. That way the stamp reflects what
was actually used to fetch the displayed data, even after the user
flips the dropdown post-scan.
