"""Persist placed put-sell trades — a single JSON log under
``options-scanner/trades/``.

One file, a list of trade records, so the Trades tab can show what was
placed, estimate P/L, and (later) close positions. Gitignored — this is
personal trade data, not shipped state.

Each record:
  id          unique short id
  ticker, strike, expiration (YYYY-MM-DD), quantity
  option_type "P" (cash-secured put) or "C" (covered call); default "P"
  credit      credit per share received at open
  status      "open" | "closing" | "rolling" | "closed" | "expired"
              | "assigned"
              ("closing" = a live buy-to-close order is working but unfilled;
               "rolling" = a live net-price roll order is working but unfilled)
  paper       bool — placed in Schwab paper/sandbox
  order_id    Schwab order id (None until placement is wired)
  opened_at   ISO-8601 timestamp
  filled_at   ISO-8601 when the opening order was first seen FILLED. Recorded
              once so "did it fill?" stops needing a Schwab read: the Trades
              tab polls order status only for orders still unresolved, and a
              collapsed row can say "open" and mean it. Absent on a paper trade
              (no broker order) and on records that predate this field.
  close_order_id  Schwab id of the buy-to-close order (set while "closing")
  close_limit_px  per-share limit on that closing order
  close_qty   contracts the working closing order is buying back (≤ quantity)
  unwind_shares   present when the close is an UNWIND — the option buyback and
              this many shares went out as one net-credit order, so the record
              describes both legs. Only the option leg's P/L is booked: the
              trade log models premium received and holds no cost basis for the
              stock, so the share sale's gain/loss lives at the broker
  close_cost  per-share cost paid to close (None while open)
  closed_at   ISO-8601 (None while open)
  fill_spot   underlying spot captured at fill (paper: at placement)
  fill_delta  option delta captured at that same moment
  fill_iv     option implied vol captured at that same moment

Roll lifecycle (Positions tab — an atomic buy-to-close + sell-to-open net order):
  roll_order_id  Schwab id of the working net-price roll order (while "rolling")
  roll_net_px    signed per-share net limit (+ = net credit, − = net debit)
  rolled_at      ISO-8601 when the roll filled / was recorded
  roll_from      {strike, expiration, option_type} of the leg rolled out of —
                 provenance on the NEW leg's record (the old leg, if it was
                 tracked, is flipped to "closed"; a live-read Schwab leg has no
                 prior record, so only the new leg is added)
