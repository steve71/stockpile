"""Persist placed put-sell trades — a single JSON log under
``options-scanner/trades/``.

One file, a list of trade records, so the Trades tab can show what was
placed, estimate P/L, and (later) close positions. Gitignored — this is
personal trade data, not shipped state.

Each record:
  id          unique short id
  ticker, strike, expiration (YYYY-MM-DD), quantity
  credit      credit per share received at open
  status      "open" | "closing" | "closed" | "expired" | "assigned"
              ("closing" = a live buy-to-close order is working but unfilled)
  paper       bool — placed in Schwab paper/sandbox
  order_id    Schwab order id (None until placement is wired)
  opened_at   ISO-8601 timestamp
  close_order_id  Schwab id of the buy-to-close order (set while "closing")
  close_limit_px  per-share limit on that closing order
  close_qty   contracts the working closing order is buying back (≤ quantity)
  close_cost  per-share cost paid to close (None while open)
  closed_at   ISO-8601 (None while open)
  fill_spot   underlying spot captured at fill (paper: at placement)
  fill_delta  option delta captured at that same moment
  fill_iv     option implied vol captured at that same moment
