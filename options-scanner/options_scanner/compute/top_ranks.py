labels for the top N picks.

Used by the IV-surface chart (to label dots), the per-expiration
chain table (to populate the Top column), and the scan-results
table — they all need the same ranking convention so a "1" in the

    Rank is 1-indexed per option type. Selling ranks by descending
    signal_score (richest first); buying ranks by ascending
    signal_score (cheapest first). signal_score defaults to iv_excess
    (falls back to it when the column is absent). open_interest is the
    tiebreaker.

    Args:
        df: Chain DataFrame with columns `type`, `strike`, `expiration`,
            `iv_excess`, `open_interest`, `volume`.
        mode: `"call"`, `"put"`, or `"both"`.
        buy: If True, sort ascending (cheap first); else descending.
        min_oi: Drop rows with open_interest below this floor.
        top_n: Keep at most this many per type.
        min_vol: Drop rows with today's volume below this floor.

    Returns:
        Empty dict when df is empty. Otherwise maps each top pick's
        identity tuple to its 1-indexed rank within its type.
